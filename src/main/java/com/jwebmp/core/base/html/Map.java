 * The map tag is supported in all major browsers. Definition and Usage<p>
 * <p>
 * The map tag is used to define a client-side image-map. An image-map is an image with clickable areas.<p>
 * <p>
 * The required name attribute of the map element is associated with the img's usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map.<p>
 * <p>
 * The map element contains a number of area elements, that defines the clickable areas in the image map. Differences Between HTML 4.01 and HTML5<p>
 * <p>
 * Note: In HTML5, if the id attribute of the map tag is also specified, it must have the same value as the name attribute. Differences Between HTML and XHTML<p>
 * <p>
 * In XHTML, the name attribute is deprecated, and will be removed. Use the id attribute instead.<p>
